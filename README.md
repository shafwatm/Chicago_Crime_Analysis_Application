"Predicting Arrests in Chicago"
-> I developed a dynamic web application using Flask and Folium to visualize crime hotspots. A peak testing accuracy of ~91% was achieved by utilizing Python, Spark, SQL and machine learning to build the predictive models on the back end of the web app. The model was created to help law enforcement officials respond to areas with higher crime density, complete with an easy-to-read heatmap, to reduce city costs and increase safety.Â 

Instructions:
Open the terminal for wsgi.py and type 'flask run' to deploy the website. The link (address) to the application is in the terminal after it runs. All the code can be found in Chicago-Crime-Analysis-App/app/main.py
